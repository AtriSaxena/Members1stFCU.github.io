    <p>Evan has over 10 years of experience in full-stack development in many aspects of .NET (Framework and Core), Angular, Node.js, and PHP. 
    Most recently Evan has been focusing on building SPA (single-page-apps) in Angular (2+) with a .NET Core or Node.js Express REST API backend. 
    He enjoys writing code following SOLID and DRY development patterns and sharing his knowledge and experiences with other developers (after 
    figuring out what patterns work and what doesn't!).</p>
    <p>When not at work, he enjoys playing PS4 games and binging shows with his wife, Kate, hanging out and playing board games with friends, 
    and cycling on rails-to-trails. Evan and Kate regularly attend (and help to manage and run) Harrisburg's local Contra Dance and International Folk Dance.
